        <p>My name is Matthew Howard (or just Matt). I work as a software engineer for Microsoft in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I graduated in May 2017 from <a href="http://upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a> with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering and a Masters Degree in Computer Science. I previously helped run <a href="http://pennapps.com" target="_blank">PennApps</a>, the nation's largest college hackathon.</p>
        <p>I have a handful of other hobbies I use to fill in the cracks, including web design, photography, guitar, singing, and hiking.</p>

            <h3>Constructing a Clique Solver from a Reduction to SAT</h3>
            <div class="subheading">Fall 2016</div>
          </header>
          <p>I developed a solver for the NP-complete Clique Decision Problem using a reduction to SAT and the powerful and popular MiniSat SAT solver. You can read about the theory and analysis of the solver in the <a href="/clique.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> and find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/moward/CliqueSolver" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h3>DriveCoin - A Space-based Cryptocurrency</h3>
            <div class="subheading">Fall 2015</div>
          </header>
          <p>For our final project for CIS 556, Cryptography, my partner Ajay Patel and I designed and implemented a Cryptocurrency based on a Proof-of-Space primitive. It was challenging to design such a complicated system that works correctly and securely even in the presence of an adversary, but we created a simple proof-of-concept including a block chain, a wallet, and a peer-to-peer network in Python. You can read our report on the project <a href="/drivecoin.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and find the source code for our implementation on <a href="https://github.com/moward/DriveCoin" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h3>Project Winwood - Self-Driving Vehicles</h3>
            <div class="subheading">Spring 2015</div>
          </header>
          <p>I built Project Winwood for my final project for ESE 350, "Microcontrollers &amp; Embedded Systems", along with my partner Chris Champaigne. The project consists of self-driving vehicles, built largely from scratch, that receive waypoints via a web-based console and navigate autonomously. The robots are controlled by C code running on a Raspberry Pi 2 and includ components for sensor interfacing, data processing and localization, and closed loop drivetrain control. Much more information on the project can be found on our <a href="http://winwood.matt.how/" target="_blank">project blog</a>.</p>

            <p>As part of my responsibilities as webmaster, I undertook the task of redesigning The Pennchants website to serve as the group's online presence. I chose  WordPress as a content management system because of its simplicity and extensive community support. I then designed a responsive theme based on <a href="http://themble.com/bones/">Bones</a>.
