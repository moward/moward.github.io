        <p>My name is Matthew Howard (or just Matt). I’m currently a rising junior studying computer engineering with a minor in mathematics at the <a href="http://upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I'm currently working as a Software Developer Intern at <a href="http://epic.com" target="_blank">Epic Systems</a> in Verona, Wisconsin. In my free time, I serve as the Vice Director of <a href="http://pennapps.com" target="_blank">PennApps</a>, one of the world’s largest hackathons. I’m also a member of the <a href="http://penngleeclub.com" target="_blank">Penn Glee Club</a> and <a href="http://pennchants.com" target="_blank">The Pennchants</a> a cappella group. This past spring, I was a teaching assistant for CIS 240, "Intro to Computer Architecture".</p>
        <p>I spent the last summer in Durham, NC working as an intern for IBM in Cloud and Smarter Infrastructure. While there, I focused on mainframe administration, product testing, and web application development.</p>
        <p>Finally, I have a handful of other hobbies I use to fill in the cracks, including web design, photography, arranging music, and hiking.</p>

            <h3>Project Winwood - Self-Driving Vehicles</h3>
          </header>
          <p>I built Project Winwood for my final project for ESE 350, "Microcontrollers &amp; Embedded Systems", along with my partner Chris Champaigne. The project consists of self-driving vehicles, built largely from scratch, that receive waypoints via a web-based console and navigate autonomously. The robots are controlled by C code running on a Raspberry Pi 2 and includ components for sensor interfacing, data processing and localization, and closed loop drivetrain control. Much more information on the project can be found on our <a href="http://winwood.matt.how/" target="_blank">project blog</a>.</p>

            <h3>Pennchants.com</h3>
            <p>As part of my responsibilities as webmaster, I undertook the task of redesigning The Pennchants website to serve as the group's online presence. I chose  WordPress as a content management system because of its simplicity and extensive community support. I then designed a responsive theme based on <a href="http://themble.com/bones/">Bones</a>. See the site at <a href="pennchants.com" target="_blank">Pennchants.com</a>.
